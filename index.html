			<h1> Short Bio: </h1>
			<p> Anbang Yao got his Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University in Jan. 2010. He is currently a Senior Staff Research Scientist </p>
				<p>at Intel Labs China where he leads the research efforts on 2D/3D scene understanding, deep neural network design </p>
				<p>and compression, emotion analysis, and so forth. He has 60+ PCT/US patent applications got granted/filed, which are widely</p>
				<p>used in Intel AI related HW designs and SW applications. As the first/corresponding author, he has published 20+ top-tier </p>
				<p>research papers in NIPS, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, TIP, PR and etc. He was recognized with ~40 Awards at Intel, including </p>
				<p>1 Intel Global Inventor (2018, 1 out of ~10000 employees of Intel China), 3 Intel Labs Gordy Awards (2014/2015/2016), </p>
				<p>Intel Labs Top-1 Inventor of the Year (2017), 2 Intel China Awards (2016/2017), 1 Employee of the Year Award of </p>
				<p>Intel China (2017) and 1 i360 Design Hero Award of Intel IOTG Asian Region (2017).</p>
