Short Bio
=====

Anbang Yao got his Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University in Jan. 2010. He is currently a Senior Staff Scientist at Intel Labs China where he leads the research efforts on developing omni-scale high-performance intelligent vision systems. He has about 70 PCT/US/EP patent applications got granted/filed, which are widely used in Intel AI HW designs (such as Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Sticks and Intel® Arria® 10  SoC FPGAs) and SW applications (such as Intel® RealSense™ SDK and Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit). As the first/corresponding author, he has published about 30 top-tier research papers in NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, TPAMI, IJCV, TIP, PR and etc. He has been recognized with numerous Awards at Intel, such as 1 Distinguished Invention Award in 2020, Intel Global Inventor of 2018 (first winner employee in China), 2 times of annual Intel China Awards, and 3 times of annual Intel Labs Gordy Awards (the highest annual research award named after Intel's co-founder Gordon Earle Moore, ***戈登·摩尔奖***). He also led the team and won the Winner of the prestigious EmotiW Challenges (held by ACM ICMI) in 2015/2017, beating out 74/100+ international teams.
